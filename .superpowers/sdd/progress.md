## Plan 1 — WFM Payroll Prep Visibility
Task 1: complete (commit 008e2ae0, base bb3dc52f, review clean — 3 minor: silent catch, N+1 getOrRefresh, month not echoed)
Task 2: complete (commit b8d6cef0, base 008e2ae0, review skipped — code matches plan verbatim, deviation to WORKERS array type documented)
Task 3: complete (commit TBD, base b3cea1e6) — useNavBadges hook (src/hooks/useNavBadges.ts) + badgedGroups injection in CompactDashboardLayout.tsx; both SidebarNav instances now receive live badge counts; 5-min stale / 10-min refetch; eligible roles: wfm, process_manager, branch_head, payroll_branch, super_admin, admin

# WFM Roster Builder — Subsystem 1 — SDD Progress Ledger
# Started: 2026-08-20
# Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-20-wfm-roster-builder-subsystem1.md
# Worktree: .claude/worktrees/wfm-roster-builder-subsystem1 (branch worktree-wfm-roster-builder-subsystem1)
# Branch start commit: 6bab5cb4

## Tasks
Task 1: complete (commit de40f8ed, base 6bab5cb4, review clean — spec compliant, no findings)
Task 2: complete (commit 09b712b6, base de40f8ed, review clean — spec compliant, no findings)
Task 3: complete (commit 868b0399, base 09b712b6, review clean — spec compliant, brief's illustrative test had 3 mocking bugs, corrected on retry with production code unchanged from brief; regression confirmed clean against 601 passing wfm/roster tests)
Task 4: complete (commit 71c61e27, base 868b0399, review clean — spec compliant, both extras judged legitimate; 21/21 tests independently confirmed)
Task 5: complete (commit cc2fa6a4, base 71c61e27, review clean — spec compliant, all 4 schema column-name claims independently re-verified against SQL migrations. Minor (non-blocking, for final review): response envelope {rows} diverges from sibling endpoint's {success,data} convention)
Task 6: complete (commit f5be0106, base cc2fa6a4, review clean — resolved brief's open shift-id question via live DB verification, independently re-confirmed by reviewer with own query: wfm_shift_template(23 UUID rows) vs wfm_shift_master(3 string-id rows), zero overlap; chose additive shiftTemplateId field over overloading shiftId. Minor cosmetic note only.)
Task 7: complete (commit 6759ec00, base f5be0106 — page shell + cycle picker over the existing /api/roster-gov/cycles endpoints; ledger line added retroactively, the task's own report is in briefs/task-7-report.md)
Tasks 8-10: complete (single commit, base 6759ec00 — the plan's per-task commits were not separable here because Tasks 8, 9 and 10 all edit RosterBuilderPage.tsx and a Task-8-only commit would have left the page unwired and its own test failing at that revision). Task 8: RosterPivotGrid with a REAL shift-template picker (the brief's window.prompt placeholder was deferred pending Task 6's shift-id question, which Task 6 answered) sourced from the existing GET /api/roster-gov/shifts/templates, a true date-column pivot, and hrmsApi instead of raw fetch (both roster-builder routes are behind requireAuth — a bare fetch would 401 every call). Task 9: cycle-aware deep link to the untouched RosterImportPage, the deferred embed still deferred. Task 10: publish button on the existing POST /api/wfm/roster/publish-to-employees. Reports in briefs/task-{8,9,10}-report.md.
Task 11 (regression): frontend 637/637 pass (63 files) including the api-endpoint-existence contract guard, which caught a real false-positive endpoint reference in a comment and is now clean. Backend wfm+roster 607 pass / 1 fail, and db guards 276 pass / 2 fail — all 3 failures pre-existing and unrelated (aprBulkEvidence.contract.test.ts from the APR manual-upload work; migration-manifest guard on 1508_noida_cost_centre_status_sync.sql missing and 1080_itc_blocked_sub_heads.sql unlisted, both from other sessions' in-flight SQL changes). Typecheck: no errors in either roster-builder file. Steps 4-5 (live WFM-role smoke on /wfm/roster-builder, and the non-WFM-role refusal check) NOT done — they need a running app against a local/staging DB and a login, and are the remaining gate before this branch can be called verified.
OPEN DEFECT for the final review (not introduced by tasks 8-10): POST /api/wfm/roster-builder/assign never passes shiftStartTime/shiftEndTime, and roster.service.ts:204 only runs minimum-rest validation when both are present — so every write from the builder grid bypasses the rest guard the four other roster-write engines share. Fix belongs server-side in the route (resolve the template's times from wfm_shift_template), not in the component.
